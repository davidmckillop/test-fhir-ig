### Profiles

#### ADHA core profiles 

The following core FHIR profiles are defined in this implementation guide. These profiles set a core standard for a FHIR R4 resource identifying additional constraints, extensions, and value sets that build on and extend [HL7 AU Australian Base Implementation Guide](http://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-base/index.html), [HL7 AU Australian Core Implementation Guide](http://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-core/branches/main/index.html), and core HL7 [FHIR R4](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/index.html).
